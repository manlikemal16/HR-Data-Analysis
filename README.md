# HR-Data-Analysis
I analysed HR management data using SQL to extract key insights for the HR department. I then visualized my findings in Power BI to support informed decision-making and strategic workforce planning.

Analysis Questions:
1. What is the gender breakdown in the Company?
2. How many employees work remotely for each department?
3. What is the distribution of employees who work remotely and HQ
4. What is the race distribution in the Company?
5. What is the distribution of employees across different states?
6. What is the number of employees whose employment has been terminated
7. Who is/are the longest-serving employee in the organisation?
8. Return the terminated employees by their race
9. What is the age distribution in the Company?
10. How have employee hire counts varied over time?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?
12. What is the average length of employment in the company
